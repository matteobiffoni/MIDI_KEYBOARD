## Overview

MIDI KEYBOARD is a piano-like instrument implemented with an AVR ATMega 2560 which allows to use the avr as a keyboard and the host as a sound-maker.

The avr hardware configuration includes:
* An AVR board (ATMega 2560)
* 7 hardware buttons to hold and release notes
* A bunch of wires to connect the buttons

The buttons must be connected to digital pins of DDRB (from bit `0` to bit `6`)
On the ATMega2560 these pins are mapped as:

| PBn |Digital Pin|
|:---:|:---------:|
|  0  |     53    |
|  1  |     52    |
|  2  |     51    |
|  3  |     50    |
|  4  |     10    |
|  5  |     11    |
|  6  |     12    |

(An image showing the avr configuration is attached ==> See `avr_hardware_conf.png`)

Every time a button is pressed or released, the avr sends an appropriate note event through the serial and the receiving host translates this event in an update of the sound production.

The "music" part is implemented with the open-source OpenAL APIs and consists in filling buffers with appropriate data and queueing/unqueueing them to update the sound production.

## Install

In order to compile required files, the *GNU Make* build system is used.

##### Prerequisites
* Open a terminal
* Run `sudo apt-get install build-essential`
* Run `sudo apt-get install git`
* Run ```sudo apt-get install libopenal1```
* Run ```sudo apt-get install libopenal-dev```

##### Download the repository:
* Open a terminal
* Go to the directory where MIDI_KEYBOARD should be stored (e.g. `cd path/to/the/directory`)
* Run `sudo git clone https://github.com/matteobiffoni/MIDI_KEYBOARD.git`

##### Compile:
* To compile both the avr and the host part, run `make all`
* To compile only the host part, run `make host`
* To compile only the avr part, run `make avr`

##### Execution:
* Run `make flash` to flash the `.hex` file on the avr. Now the program is running on the microcontroller
* To execute the host part, run `./target/host/midi_keyboard`

##### Cleaning:
* To remove all the `.o` files and the executables, run `make clean`

##### Notes:
* Make sure the host is provided with a sound producing peripherial (such as speakers) and has its volume enabled
* If no avr is available, an OpenAL test using PC keyboard is present at `./test_openal` 

*(Note that in the openal test the notes are enabled/disabled on every key press, whereas in the avr implementation each key pressure causes the note enabling and each key release causes the note disabling)*

##### Note event structure

| Field   | Size (bits) |                           Description                          |
|:-------:|:-----------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|
|Padding  |      3      |                 Zeros needed to reach a byte                   |
|Parity   |      1      |     A bit containing the parity checksum for the note event    |
|Value    |      3      | Represents the pitch this note event refers to (details below) |
|State    |      1      |         Represents the state of this event (details below)     |
